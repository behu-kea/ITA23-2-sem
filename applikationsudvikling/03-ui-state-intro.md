# UI & State

Compose is a declarative UI framework, meaning that you *declare* how the UI should look in your code.



## @Composable





## Composition

The *Composition* is a description of the UI built by Compose when it executes composables. Compose apps call composable functions to transform data into UI.



### Initial composition

Initial composition is a creation of the UI by Compose when it executes composable functions the first time.



### Recomposition

Recomposition is the process of running the same composables again to update the tree when their data changes.

The *Composition* is a description of the UI built by Compose  when it executes composables. Compose apps call composable functions to transform data into UI. If a state change happens, Compose re-executes  the affected composable functions with the new state, which creates an  updated UIâ€”this is called *recomposition*. Compose schedules a *recomposition* for you.

When Compose runs your composables for the first time during *initial composition*

*Recomposition* is when Compose re-executes the composables that  may have changed in response to data changes and then updates the  Composition to reflect any changes.

The Composition can only be produced by an *initial composition* and updated by *recomposition*. The only way to modify the Composition is through *recomposition*. To do this, *Compose needs to know what state to track* so that it can schedule the recomposition when it receives an update.

The value returned by the `mutableStateOf()` function:

- Holds state, which is the bill amount.
- Is mutable, so the value can be changed.
- Is observable, so Compose observes any changes to the value and triggers a recomposition to update the UI.



## State

State in an app is any value that can change over time.



## State hoisting

A *stateless* composable is a composable that doesn't have a  state, meaning it doesn't hold, define, or modify a new state. On the  other hand, a *stateful* composable is a composable that owns a piece of state that can change over time.

State hoisting is a pattern of moving state to its caller to make a component stateless.
