**Higher or lower**

- Create a new application
- Your task is to implement the simple game **higher or lower**
  - User has 3 guesses to guess the number generated by the computer
  - The computer has to help the user and tell if the number is higher or lower than the last guess
  - All game state should be controlled by a ViewModel class

**Advanced (Optional)**

- Instead of guessing a single number, the computer generates a list of numbers between 1-10.
- The user guesses one number at a time and at the end gets displayed how many was guessed correctly
