TDD - Test driven development. Write tests first. Then start developing code. Could maybe be huge in the age of AI



What makes a good test:

- Scope - How much coverage 
- Speed - The faster then more you will use it
- Fidelity- How close to real scenario
- Not a flaky test



Three types of tests:

1. Unit tests - single units. Fx function `getSum` . 70% of our app
2. Integration tests - How two components work together. Interaction betwen components. 20 %
3. UI tests/end-to-end - Whole interaction. Log in, then click a button etc



## Test strategy

- **Success path:** The success path tests - also known as happy path tests, focus on testing the functionality for a positive flow.
- **Error path:** The error path tests focus on testing the  functionality for a negative flow–that is, to check how the app responds to error conditions or invalid user input.
- **Boundary case:** A boundary case focuses on testing boundary conditions in the app.
