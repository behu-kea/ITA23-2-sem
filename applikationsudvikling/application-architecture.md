# Application architecture

### **ViewModel exercise**

https://github.com/nicklasdean/court-counter/tree/main

- Refactor the code such that the UI is driven from the *Score* model

- (Advanced) Notice that a lot of code is very close to duplication and redundancy
  - What changes can you make that simplifies the code
  - Hint - can we use parameter inputs to reduce the amount of methods? 

### Refactoring changes

**In your project groups**

Write a brief report and answer the following questions:

- How well does your application adhere to the introduced principles (Seperation of concerns, unidirectional data flow, single source of truth, Drive UI from data model)? 
  - Why? Describe why/why not with examples.

    

- What **changes** could **better** your application?
  - Make at least 2 suggestions on how to refactor your application to adhere to the 1 or more of the above principles.

  - Argue with concrete code examples or class diagrams

    

- How could a design pattern be implemented and contribute in your application?

  - Make a suggestion to redesign a part of your application or a new feature, to implement a GoF pattern such as:
  - (Abstract) Factory, Singleton, Adapter, Template Method
